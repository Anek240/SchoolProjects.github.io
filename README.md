<p><strong>AYYY—WELCOME-A TO TONY’S ITALIAN GRILL</strong></p>

<p>Where the sauce is-a rich, the portions are-a <em>criminal</em>, and subtlety? Eh. We don’t-a know her.</p>

<p>You hungry? Of course you’re hungry. You walk in, you smell-a the garlic, the olive oil, the dreams-a of your ancestors. Pasta so fresh it’s still got opinions. Chicken parm bigger than your steering wheel. Lasagna stacked so high it should-a need zoning approval.</p>

<p>Every dish is cooked loud, served hotter, and judged silently if you don’t finish it. This is not food. This is-a commitment.</p>

<p><strong>Authentic?</strong> Fuggedaboutit.<br>
<strong>Delicate?</strong> No, no, no.<br>
<strong>Absolutely fantastico?</strong> Finalmente, yes.</p>

<p>Now, the safety ratings—ahhh, relax. We have them. Somewhere. Probably framed.</p>

<p><strong>Tony’s Italian Grill</strong><br>
Come for the food.<br>
Stay because you can’t move.<br>
Leave full, happy, and asking zero follow-up questions.</p>
